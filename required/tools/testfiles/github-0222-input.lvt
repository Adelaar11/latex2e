% In |\verbatim@input| (which is called by |\verbatiminput| it's a bit
% unsafe to run \@verbatim (which includes a hook \every@verbatim)
% before relying on the value of \@filef@und. Same issue (and same
% fix) as we had for \InputIfFileExists. 
%
% Given that the file "verb-test.tex" exists this testfile tyepsets
% the contents of the file ".tex" in LaTeX release <2020/02/02> and
% verbatim version 1.5r.
% This happens because the call to \input in the \every@verbatim
% hook overwrites the \@filef@und that was test.tex.
%
% So we have to make sure the necessary file is found. If it is not, an
% error message will be issued and the processing of |\verbatiminput|
% ends as expected, without typesetting anything.
